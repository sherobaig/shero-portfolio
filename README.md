## 🧑‍💻 EECS 168 — Programming I (Python Foundations)

📘 *EECS 168: Programming I*  
🔗 https://github.com/sherobaig/EECS168Projects

This repository contains all individual lab assignments completed for EECS 168, an introductory programming course focused on **Python fundamentals, problem-solving, and computational thinking**. Each lab builds progressively on prior concepts, moving from basic syntax to structured, multi-component programs.

---

### 🧪 Lab 2 — Variables & Basic Input/Output  
🔗 https://github.com/sherobaig/EECS168Projects/tree/main/Lab2

Introduces fundamental Python syntax, including variable assignment, arithmetic operations, and console input/output. Programs focus on interacting with the user and producing correctly formatted output.

**Concepts**
- Variables and data types  
- User input with `input()`  
- Output formatting and expressions  

---

### 🔀 Lab 3 — Conditional Logic  
🔗 https://github.com/sherobaig/EECS168Projects/tree/main/Lab3

Focuses on decision-making using conditional statements. Programs respond dynamically to user input and computed conditions.

**Concepts**
- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements  
- Boolean expressions and comparisons  
- Input validation  

---

### 🔁 Lab 4 — Loops & Iteration  
🔗 https://github.com/sherobaig/EECS168Projects/tree/main/Lab4

Introduces repetition through loops. Students implement programs that repeat tasks efficiently and handle repeated input patterns.

**Concepts**
- `for` and `while` loops  
- Loop control and termination conditions  
- Nested loops  

---

### 🗃 Lab 5 — Lists & Data Collections  
🔗 https://github.com/sherobaig/EECS168Projects/tree/main/Lab5

Explores Python lists as a way to store and manipulate collections of data. Programs iterate over lists and perform calculations on stored values.

**Concepts**
- Lists and indexing  
- Iteration over collections  
- Basic list operations  

---

### 🧠 Lab 6 — Functions & Modular Programming  
🔗 https://github.com/sherobaig/EECS168Projects/tree/main/Lab6

Introduces writing reusable functions to improve program organization and readability. Emphasizes breaking large problems into smaller components.

**Concepts**
- Defining and calling functions  
- Parameters and return values  
- Code modularity  

---

### 📂 Lab 7 — File Input & Output  
🔗 https://github.com/sherobaig/EECS168Projects/tree/main/Lab7

Focuses on reading from and writing to files. Programs process stored data and produce output files based on computation results.

**Concepts**
- File reading and writing  
- Processing file-based data  
- Handling structured input  

---

### 🧩 Lab 8 — Lists of Lists & Structured Data  
🔗 https://github.com/sherobaig/EECS168Projects/tree/main/Lab8

Introduces working with multi-dimensional data using nested lists. Programs model grid-like or table-based data structures.

**Concepts**
- Lists of lists  
- Nested iteration  
- Structured data processing  

---

### 🔍 Lab 9 — Debugging & Program Testing  
🔗 https://github.com/sherobaig/EECS168Projects/tree/main/Lab9

Emphasizes identifying and fixing logical and runtime errors. Students test programs using multiple inputs and edge cases.

**Concepts**
- Debugging strategies  
- Error tracing  
- Test case design  

---

### 🏁 Lab 10 — Final Integrated Python Lab  
🔗 https://github.com/sherobaig/EECS168Projects/tree/main/Lab10

A cumulative lab combining multiple concepts from the course into a single structured program. Demonstrates overall mastery of Python fundamentals.

**Concepts**
- Multi-function program design  
- Integration of conditionals, loops, lists, and files  
- Clean, readable, and maintainable code  

---

> Together, these labs demonstrate a strong foundation in Python programming and problem-solving, forming the basis for advanced coursework in data structures, databases, and software engineering.
