  - <a>🚀 ¥apper — Multi-Room Chat Application

EECS 581 (Software Engineering II) Project

¥apper is a full-stack, real-time multi-room chat application built as part of a university software engineering course project. It enables users to create profiles, join chat rooms, and communicate live with others in dedicated spaces — showcasing both frontend UX design and backend API development.

This project demonstrates core software engineering skills including requirements understanding, system design, iterative development, and integration testing in a team environment, following structured SE principles from EECS 581: Software Engineering II.

🛠 Key Features

User Authentication & Profiles – Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.

Multi-Room Chatting – Real-time messaging across rooms with room-creation support.

Responsive UI – Built with modern frontend frameworks for a smooth user experience.

💻 Tech Stack

Frontend: React + TypeScript

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Real-Time Communication: WebSockets / socket support

Deployment & Development Tools: Node.js, Python virtual environment, npm uv tooling

📌 Highlights

Integrated full-stack development workflow connecting a REST API backend with a reactive frontend.

Built to adhere to modern software engineering practices including modular architecture, environment isolation, and documented setup.

Demonstrates collaborative and scalable application design in a classroom team project.</a>

  - <a> 🚀 Minesweeper — Full-Stack Team Project

EECS 581 (Software Engineering II) Spring 2025

Minesweeper is a web-based implementation of the classic logic puzzle game where players uncover cells on a grid while avoiding hidden mines. Developed collaboratively by Team 28 for EECS 581: Software Engineering II, this project demonstrates modern web development practices paired with solid software engineering principles — from system design and modular architecture to responsive client interaction and team-driven workflow.

This build delivers a playable, polished version of Minesweeper that runs in the browser with an intuitive UI and dynamic game logic. It bridges frontend experience with backend logic and shows practical application of TypeScript, React/Next.js, and stateful game mechanics.

🎯 Key Features

Interactive Minesweeper Gameplay — Clickable grid, mine detection, and real-time computation of adjacent counts for strategic play.

Responsive Web Interface — Built for smooth, intuitive user interaction across devices.

Team-Oriented Engineering — Project structure + documentation support maintainability and collaborative development.

🧰 Tech Stack

Frontend: TypeScript, React / Next.js

Styling: CSS modules / Tailwind (based on project setup)

Tooling: Node.js, npm for development scripts and dependency management

Version Control: Git & GitHub workflow for team coordination and continuous integration

📌 Highlights

Showcases software modularity, separation of UI and game logic, and real-time rendering of gameplay state.

Demonstrates full-stack web development skills applicable to logic-driven interactive applications.

A strong example of cohesive team engineering in an academic setting, mirroring professional collaboration patterns.</a>
